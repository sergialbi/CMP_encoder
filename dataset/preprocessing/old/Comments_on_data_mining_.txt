#Comments on data mining:
- created a count of each party-year manifesto (sentences are interrelated and therefore the order is relevant)
- identifying parties
- identifying language

- deleted (some) bullet point and alike
- deleted (some) special characters in sentences


#Thinks to take into account for the analysis
- single words that are codified alone: they need to be attached to the previous sentence. They have a different code than the previous sentence but the content of the previous cell allows codifying it
- we probably need to create a categorisation for national vs regional parties. Regional parties will, ceteris paribus, be more likely to refer to some aspects than national ones (and the system should take this into account).
- think how to break down sentences in party manifestos into codifiable sentences (!)
